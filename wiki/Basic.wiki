#Basic outline

= Introduction =
Try and split project into smaller systems

= Details =
Client Contacts (Outlook/WAB)<br>
Sync System<br>
Server Contacts (MySQL/PostGreSQL)<br>

Client Contacts system<br>
 Read and write into Outlook/WAB

Server Contacts<br>
 Read and write into DB

Sync System<br>
 What is needed for client `<->` server sync

<br>
Believe what might be easiest to work with is to be able to export
Contacts to csv, clean out Outlook/WAB and re-import from CSV

Work with an easy selected fields, this might leave open the place for
bugs, but testing before hand with a large set and more eyes on the
project, could quick help move through basic features.
