Current project state has not taken complete 64Bit installed systems, like Vista64, into account.  I don't believe want we have as the date of writing this, that native 64bit system will work with this.

Also have not put any thought into UTFâˆ’8 encoding, from what I have readed, while doing basic research on this project, we will have to work at adding support for any encoding other than standard Western Character set.

Optimization, like early or late bindings in the Windows COM system, might be worth looking into at once the basic project was got legs.
