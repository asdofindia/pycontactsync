Current project state has not taken complete 64Bit installed systems, like Vista64, into account.  I don't believe want we have as the date of writing this, that native 64bit system will work with this.

Also have not put any thought into UTFâˆ’8 encoding, from what I have readed, while doing basic research on this project, we will have to work at adding support for any encoding other than standard Western Character set.

Optimization, like early or late bindings in the Windows COM system, might be worth looking into at once the basic project was got legs.

Was thinking last night about syncing (That sounds funny), not sure how N81 '<->' Outlook '<->' DB might work ... There might be problems, seeing that Googles Contact Sync, Nokia Sync and Outlook seems to have some problems ... I think that only most of the other syncing system normally only suggest a single sync host or system.
